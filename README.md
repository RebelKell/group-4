## Overview
For this project our team is going to take a closer look at potential causality of fatale vehicle accidents in the state of Oregon. We will look at what factors are present in crash data from 2011 to 2015 including age, intoxication level, speed, etc. and try to determine what, if any, correlation exists between factors and the probability of a crash and where they happen.

We decided to focus on this after being initially interested in what makes intersections dangerous for pedestrians after reading this article on the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.vox.com/23178764/florida-us19-deadliest-pedestrian-fatality-crisis?fbclid%3DIwAR01wf7MAKZq0WSfzcHIXdFbYVJIQZu4Tfx4n5NoxRreMgKYhDvdrX1_LmQ&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1660099190520573&usg=AOvVaw1brG1VsDvkzz6zmrkaunKn">Deadliest Road in America</a>, but found that the data cited in a lot of the research papers was not accessible and decided to expand the scope of our inquiry. In general, we are all interested in exploring this topic as it could provide insight into a real-world problem that has devastating impacts on the people involved in fatal automobile accidents.

We will use an unsupervised machine learning algorithm with the intent of examining how these factors are clustered. We are interested to see which factors go into each cluster and each cluster's share of the dataset. 

To do this analysis we will use data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administrationâ€™s (NHTSA) Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) which has an excellent <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://cdan.dot.gov/query&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1660099224827534&usg=AOvVaw20YALS4-fo7wnJHcGq-CRR">query tool</a> to pull data on this subject. 

Depending on the results of our unsupervised machine learning algorithm we may take our analysis further by inputting the data into a supervised machine learning model to compare the predicted number of fatal accidents and cluster proportions per county to the actuals. 


## Collaboration Tools
To collaborate for this project we are using a Google Doc to collect our initial thoughts/brainstorming. We are using Slack to stay in touch asynchronously and using Zoom to host group meetings to talk through portions we are working on together.


## Presentation Preparation
We have a very <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1sumsFd5GnrvDwHLD4QbD8gdcZRA34VOBbRvQ7aJMU50/edit#slide=id.p1">rough draft of a deck in Google Slides</a> which will be ou main presentation and will link to our Tableau dashboard.
